Savings Definition
******************

*P&L* **Productivity** refers to cost reduction initiatives which lead to real *YoY* *P&L* savings in fixed and variable costs

- **Cost Reduction**: The inititaive must lead to lower costs resulting in higher net operating profit before tax (NOBT)after incorporating all other relavent costs of the initiative

- **Year-Over-Year (YoY)**: The cost savings must be vs. the prior year *(PY)*, this means that avoiding costs we haven't incurred or saving vs a plan rate does not count

- **P&L Savings**: Initiatives that lead to savings that don’t directly impact the *P&L*, such as reducing capital costs, do not count as “Productivity” in this context. They have their own framework [1]_.


**Note**
- In order to properly define the contribution made by the procurement function, we need to clearly define the different frameworks under which we would want to measure the contribution made by Procurement. 

.. [1] Capex Framework, Project Bid Framework etc.
